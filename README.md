# Analyzing the Casablanca Stock Exchange data project

The stock exchange is a regulated market where securities of listed companies are traded. It was established in 1929 as a clearing house and has undergone several structural changes over time. In 1995, a management company was established to manage the stock exchange under the guidelines of the Ministry of Finance. This change in the stock exchange's structure was part of a larger modernization effort of the financial market, which began in 1993, aimed at providing the stock exchange with a modern organizational structure and tools to enhance its role in financing the economy.
The Casablanca Stock Exchange holds the public service concession for managing the stock market.
Its share capital is jointly owned by brokerage firms which have sole authority to execute stock market trades.
